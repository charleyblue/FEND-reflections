Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A, You initialize a local repo by using the git init command. This will setup the current directory as a Git
Repository so you can begin to commit changes. You can use the command git status to check how many files
are include in the new repo, if any, and if they have been committed or not. After git init you will not
have any commits yet so that you can write commit messages.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The Staging Area is an intermediary logical area between the Working Directory and the Git repository. It allows the developer to
stage commits without add all files. I have found that things like node folders do not transfer well to GitHub so
you may leave them out.
