Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. I would use a remote repository when I wanted to collaborate with a team, back-up my work, or wanted to share with others.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. I would think that for manual git pull, you maintain control over what is pulled from the remote and when you pull files.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A. Forks are copies of public repositories that you make on GitHub. A forked repo lives on your remote account as well as the original
author and you use it to build off of the original repo. Clones are copies that you download from the remote to your local repository. You
would clone someone's repo if you are going to contribute to a project and get permission to submit changes.
Branches are a new commit direction that you want to take your project in like adding a new feature before committing it to the
working project.
